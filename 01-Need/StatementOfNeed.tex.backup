\title{Automatic Applicator\\ Statement of Need}

\maketitle

The primary purpose for this project is to automate the painting process in Auvitronics. The part that is
painted the most number of times in the company is the wheel-cover and so the main requirement is to 
automate its production. But ideally this process should be able to take care of all the parts 
currently being painted in the plant.

A secondary purpose of the project is to acquire the ability to design robotic arms for automation purposes.
This project should hopefully clarify the challenges associated with designing of robotic arms in Pakistan.
Once we complete this project successfully, we will feel more confident to design robotic arms locally
to meet other automation requirements within this company and outside.
